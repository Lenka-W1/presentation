					<h3 style="color: #8b743d;">What is GitHub?<br>And what is it for?</h3>
				</section>
				<section style="text-align: initial;">
					<p><strong style="color: #8b743d;">GitHub</strong>
				       is an international web service for hosting IT projects and their joint development.
					</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">
						The creators of the site call GitHub a "social network for developers."
						In addition to posting code, members can chat, comment on each other's edits,
						and follow the news of friends.
					</p>

				<section>
                    <h3 style="color: #8b743d;">Repository</h3>
					<p style="text-align: initial;">
					    A repository is a directory where your project files are stored. 
				        It can be located in a GitHub repository or in a local repository on your computer.
					    You can store code files, images, audio, or anything related to a project in the repository.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p style="text-align: initial;">The repository can be public, which is available to everyone and private, which is available only to you.</p>
					<img src="assets/create_repository.png" alt="create repository" style="height: 500px; width: 500px;">
					<aside class="notes">
						Previously, GitHub allowed up to three developers to connect for free to private repositories
						intended for the development of non-public or confidential projects,
						access to which was provided only to a narrow circle of developers.
						After the removal of restrictions on private repositories 
						and the transfer of this functionality to the category of completely free,
						each user of GitHub got the opportunity to create private repositories for free with an unlimited number of participants.

				<section>
					<h3 style="color: #8b743d;">Repository Forking</h3>
					<p style="text-align: initial;">
						Forking a repository means that you are creating a new project based on an existing repository.
                        In simple terms, forking a repository means that you are copying an existing repository,
						making some necessary changes, save the new version as a new repository and call it your own project.
					</p>
					<img src="assets/fork.png" alt="fork">
					<aside class="notes">
						This is a great feature that speeds up project development.
						Since this is a brand new project, the central repository will not be affected.
						If the "master" repository is updated, you can also apply that update to your current fork.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3 style="color: #8b743d;">Pull Request</h3>
					<p style="text-align: initial;">
						A pull request is a request to push changes from your branch to the master branch of the source repository.
						In most cases, a pull request is used to integrate new functionality or fix a bug in the main branch of a project.
					</p>

					<h3 style="color: #8b743d;">GitHub Issues</h3>
					<p style="text-align: initial;">GitHub Issues is one of the most popular issue trackers in the world.</p>
					<img src="assets/issue.png" alt="issue" style="height: 120px;">
					<img src="assets/create_new_issue.png" alt="create new issue" style="height: 260px;">
				</section>
				<section>
					<p style="text-align: initial;">
						<span style="color: #8b743d;">GitHub Issues</span> provide repository owners with the ability to organize,
						tag, and associate issues with specific development milestones.
                        If you create an issue on another user's project,
						it will remain open until you or someone else resolves it,
						or the repository owner simply closes it.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Sometimes your questions are answered immediately.
						And it also happens that the task hangs for months in anticipation of a solution.
						During this time, you will receive comments from other developers and in the future you can return to it to fix something or improve the code.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
			        <h3 style="color: #8b743d;">GitHub Wiki</h3>
					<p style="text-align: initial;">
						Every repository on GitHub has a documentation section called a wiki.

				</section>
				<section>
				  <p style="text-align: initial;">
					  You can use your repository's <span style="color: #8b743d;">wiki</span> to share detailed information about your project, such as how to use it, how you developed it, or its core principles.
				  </p>
				  <aside class="notes">
				      Only repository contributors can edit the default public repository wiki, but you can allow anyone with a GitHub account to edit your wiki.
				  </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3 style="color: #8b743d;">GitHub Pages</h3>
					<p style="text-align: initial;">
						GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through GitHub.
						You can use GitHub Pages to showcase some open source projects, host a blog, or even share your resume.
					</p>

					<h3 style="color: #8b743d;">Summarizing</h3>
					<p style="text-align: initial;">
						We have covered only a part of all GitHub features.
						GitHub is a great tool to help make the coding process even easier and more enjoyable.
						Moreover, this is a great opportunity to work on real projects.
						GitHub is something that will be equally useful for both novice programmers and experienced ones.
